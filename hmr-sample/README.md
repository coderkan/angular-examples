# HMR Hot Module Replecament

Hi everyone,

In this article, I would like to show you how to implement HMR-Hot Module Replecament to your Angular project.

When developing a project with Angular's default configurations, whenever you saved your project(`Ctrl+S`) the project is recompiled. The whole project recompiled. This situation may cause time loss when developing.

At this moment, I did some research, and I found HMR to decrease recompilation for Angular.

## Create New Project

Let's begin to create a new project with angular-cli like below command.

    ng new hmr-sample

The output is like below image.

Successfully created a project and you also run with 

    ng serve --open

command.

## What is HMR (Hot Module Replacement)

Hot Module Replacement(HMR) is a feature of Webpack. The HMR updates your angular project without whole project recompile and reload.

You also check it out [this](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hot-module-replacement/) website for more information about HMR.


Let's go to implementations.

Firstly we need to add a new enviroment to use HMR.

### Environment for HMR

Add a file to `src/environments/environment.hmr.ts` and insert below contents.

```typescript
export const environment = {
 production: false,
 hmr: true
};
```

After added above file, we need to update `src/environments/environment.prod.ts` and add the 'hmr' property like below.

```typescript
export const environment = {
 production: true,
 hmr: false
};
```

After added above contents we need to update default environment(`src/environments/environment.ts`) properties like below context.
```typescript
export const environment = {
 production: false,
 hmr: false
};
```

After adding to environments this contents we should update `angular.json` file. We will enable hmr when the project build and serve. Add below contents to your `angular.json` file.


```json
  "build": {
    "configurations": {
      ...
      "hmr": {
        "fileReplacements": [
          {
            "replace": "src/environments/environment.ts",
            "with": "src/environments/environment.hmr.ts"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  ...
  "serve": {
    "configurations": {
      ...
      "hmr": {
        "hmr": true,
        "browserTarget": "<project-name>:build:hmr"
      }
    }
  }
```

Please attention this, the `<project-name>` is your project name. My project name is `hmr-sample.`

We should add types to `src/tsconfig.app.json` as `node`.

```json
{
  ...
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "types": ["node"]
  },
}
```

After above configuration you should use HMR with below command.

    ng serve --configuration hmr

If you would like to add shortcut you should add to your `package.json` below contents.

```json
"scripts": {
  ...
  "hmr": "ng serve --configuration hmr"
}
```

After adding above configuration to project, we should add @angularclass/hmr module as a dev-dependency.
 
    $ npm install --save-dev @angularclass/hmr
 

Create a file called `src/hmr.ts` with the following content:

```typescript
import { NgModuleRef, ApplicationRef } from '@angular/core';
import { createNewHosts } from '@angularclass/hmr';

export const hmrBootstrap = (module: any, bootstrap: () => Promise<NgModuleRef<any>>) => {
  let ngModule: NgModuleRef<any>;
  module.hot.accept();
  bootstrap().then(mod => ngModule = mod);
  module.hot.dispose(() => {
    const appRef: ApplicationRef = ngModule.injector.get(ApplicationRef);
    const elements = appRef.components.map(c => c.location.nativeElement);
    const makeVisible = createNewHosts(elements);
    ngModule.destroy();
    makeVisible();
  });
};
```
After added above contents to your `src/hmr.ts`file, we need to update our `src/main.ts`file like below contents.

```typescript
import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';

import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';
import { environment } from './environments/environment';

import { hmrBootstrap } from './hmr';

if (environment.production) {
  enableProdMode();
}

const bootstrap = () => platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);

if (environment.hmr) {
  if (module[ 'hot' ]) {
    hmrBootstrap(module, bootstrap);
  } else {
    console.error('HMR is not enabled for webpack-dev-server!');
    console.log('Are you using the --hmr flag for ng serve?');
  }
} else {
  bootstrap().catch(err => console.log(err));
}
```

After added above contents to our project, we have finished implementation of HMR to our Angular project. You easily run your app with below command.

    $ npm run hmr


You will see the a message about HMR is enable like below in your terminal.


    NOTICE Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is enabled for the dev server.


![HMR enabled image](src/assets/hmr_enabled_ss.png)

When you change your files and save them, the hmr will automatically change your contents without recompile and reload whole project.

Let's compare between HMR enable and not enabled situations.

### Without HMR

Without HMR your project will run like this.

![Without HMR](src/assets/hmr_notenabled.mov)

> As you see below video, when you make a change your project and saved, your project will always recompile and reload. This becomes a boring situation over time.


### With HMR

Now with HMR is enabled scenario. Run your app like below.

    npm run hmr

![With HMR](src/assets/hmr_enabled.mov)

> At this video you see, your project not reloaded every changes and It is faster than before.
